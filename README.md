# TreeBuilder
Creation of an unordered/unsorted binary tree where each node is labeled with a word.
A word is combination of uppercase and lowercase English letters. 
There are no duplicate nodes in the tree, all nodes have distinct labels.

The tree is represented in the file as multiple lines, each line corresponds to a node and its direct children and written as:
Parent, Left, Right

If a node does not have a left or right child, we will put # character instead of the child. 
The lines in the file can appear in random order.
